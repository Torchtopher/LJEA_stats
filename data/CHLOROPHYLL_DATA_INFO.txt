LJEA Chlorophyll Data Documentation
====================================

File: LJEA_chloro_data.xlsx

Overview:
- Chlorophyll a measurements at Lake James sites (2018-2025)
- Units: µg/L (micrograms per liter)
- Measured monthly May-October each year
- Lake sites only (no stream/river sites)

Sheets:
- "2018" through "2025": Individual year data
- "Trend 18-23" and "Trend 2018-2025": Annual average trends
- "Sheet1": Summary statistics

Data Structure (yearly sheets):
-------------------------------
Row 4: Headers - Date, LJ 6 (µg/L), LJ 7 (µg/L), LJ 8 (µg/L), LJ 9 (µg/L), LJ 11 (µg/L), Mean, mean w/o 6
Row 5+: Monthly measurements (May-October)
Last data row: Annual mean

Sites (Lake James only):
- LJ 6: Plantation Point (often has highest values - algae accumulation)
- LJ 7: Big Island
- LJ 8: Marion Lake Club
- LJ 9: Paddy Creek Dam
- LJ 11: Lower Linville

Note: "mean w/o 6" excludes LJ 6 (Plantation Point) which often has elevated values
due to localized conditions.

Chlorophyll a Interpretation:
- < 2.5 µg/L: Oligotrophic (low nutrients, clear water)
- 2.5-8 µg/L: Mesotrophic (moderate nutrients)
- > 8 µg/L: Eutrophic (high nutrients, potential algae issues)

Parsing Notes:
--------------
- Use header=None, data starts at row 5 (0-indexed: 4)
- Column 1: Date (datetime or string like "May 2025")
- Columns 2-6: Site values (LJ 6, 7, 8, 9, 11)
- Column 8: Mean of all sites
- Column 9: Mean excluding LJ 6
- Dates may be datetime objects or strings depending on year

Trend Data (Trend 2018-2025 sheet):
- Row 3: Headers (Year, Whole lake)
- Rows 4-11: Annual whole-lake averages (2018-2025)
- Rows 14-19: Annual averages without LJ 6

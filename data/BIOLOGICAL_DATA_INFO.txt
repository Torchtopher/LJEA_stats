LJEA Biological Data Documentation
===================================

File: LJEA_biological_data.xlsx

Sheets:
- "Year by Year Data" - PRIMARY DATA SHEET for time series analysis
- "Comparison Data" - Cross-site comparison for a single time period
- "Chart Calculations" - Supporting calculations
- "Charts" - Empty (charts are in Excel)

Data Structure (Year by Year Data):
-----------------------------------
Data is organized in blocks, one per site. Each block contains:
- Row 1: Site name and location (e.g., "White Creek - Above Route 126")
- Row 2: Time periods as headers (Fall 2018, Summer 2019, Summer 2020, etc.)
- Rows 3+: Metrics with values for each time period

Metrics Available:
- Total Taxa Richness: Count of unique macroinvertebrate taxa
- EPT Taxa Richness: Count of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera taxa (pollution-sensitive)
- Total Abundance: Total count of individuals
- EPT Abundance: Count of EPT individuals
- Percent EPT: EPT Abundance / Total Abundance
- Intolerant Species (< 2.5 Tolerance Value): Count of pollution-intolerant species
- NCBI Score: North Carolina Biotic Index (KEY METRIC for graphs)
- Theoretical Bioclassification: Rating based on NCBI (Excellent, Good, Good-Fair, Fair, Poor)

NCBI Score Interpretation:
- < 2.5: Excellent
- 2.5-3.5: Good
- 3.5-4.5: Good-Fair / Fair
- 4.5-5.5: Fair
- > 5.5: Poor

Time Periods:
- Fall 2018, Summer 2019, Summer 2020, Winter 2021, Summer 2022, Summer 2023, Summer 2024, Summer 2025

Sites in Data (mapped to INSTRUCTIONS.txt groups):
--------------------------------------------------
Group 1:
- Mill Creek @ Andrews Geyser (Upper Mill @ Andrews Geyser)
- Mackey Creek below Hwy 70
- Crooked Creek @ McHone Dr.
- Catawba River @ Parker Padgett Rd (proxy for Greenlee Park)

Group 2:
- North Fork Catawba River - American Thread Rd (Upper North Fork / Armstrong Creek area)
- North Fork Catawba River - North Cove School Rd (Lower North Fork)
- Armstrong Creek above Hwy 221

Group 3:
- Linville River @ Griffin Cottage (Fonta Flora area)
- White Creek - Above Route 126
- Linville River off Newland Hwy (near Blue Ridge Parkway)

Parsing Notes:
--------------
- Header row is NOT row 0; data starts with site blocks
- Use header=None when reading, then parse manually
- Empty cells (NaN) indicate no sampling that period
- NCBI Score row index varies by block; search for "NCBI Score" in column 0
